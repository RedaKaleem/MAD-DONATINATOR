# DONATINATOR
### A Smart Blood Donation Management and Tracking System

</div>

---

## Abstract

DONATINATOR is a smart, user-centric system designed to **simplify, organize, and encourage blood donation** by providing a digital platform for tracking donations, scheduling future donations, and discovering nearby blood donation camps and hospitals.

The project aims to reduce friction in the blood donation process and improve donor engagement through **reminders, history tracking, and location-based discovery**.

---

## Motivation

Blood donation is a critical public health activity, yet the process of:

- Remembering donation dates  
- Finding nearby donation centers or camps  
- Tracking personal donation history  

is still largely **unorganized and fragmented** for many donors.

This often leads to:

- Missed eligible donation windows  
- Poor donor retention  
- Lack of structured personal records  

DONATINATOR is motivated by the need for a **simple, reliable, and donor-focused digital system** that makes donating blood a habit rather than a hassle.

## Problem Statement

To design a system that:

- Helps users track their past blood donations  
- Reminds users when they are eligible to donate again  
- Shows nearby blood donation camps and hospitals  
- Maintains a clean and accessible donation history  
- Encourages consistent participation in blood donation  

---

## Proposed Solution

DONATINATOR provides:

- A personal donation dashboard  
- A scheduling and reminder system  
- A location-based discovery module for nearby camps and hospitals  
- A persistent donation history log  

The system is designed as a **mobile-first application** to ensure accessibility and ease of use.
